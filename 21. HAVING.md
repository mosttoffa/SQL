## HAVING
âœ… <B>HAVING </b> <BR>  HAVING is like WHERE but operates on grouped records. HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is present.Groups that meet the HAVING criteria will be returned.HAVING is used with aggregrates: COUNT, MAX, SUM, etc.

	-- Example:  List the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 10 customers. 
		SELECT Country, COUNT(Id) 'Total Customer'
		FROM Customer
		GROUP BY Country 
		HAVING COUNT(Id) > 10
	-- HAVING and ORDER BY
	-- Example: List the number of customers in each country, except the USA, sorted high to low. Only include countries with 9 or more customers. 
		SELECT Country, COUNT(Id)'Total Customers'
		FROM Customer 
		WHERE Country <> 'USA'
		GROUP BY Country
		HAVING COUNT(Id) > 9 
		ORDER BY COUNT(Id) DESC
	-- HAVING with AVG BETWEEN
	-- Example: List customer with average orders between $1000 and $1200. 
		SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, CONVERT(DECIMAL(10,2), AVG(O.TotalAmount))'Average Order'
		FROM [Order] O
		INNER JOIN Customer C ON O.CustomerId=C.Id
		GROUP BY C.FirstName, C.LastName
		HAVING AVG(O.TotalAmount) BETWEEN 1000 AND 1200
