üî∑ <B>GROUP BY with COUNT, ORDER BY </B>  <BR> 
üëâ Example: List the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low. 
<PRE>SELECT Country, COUNT(Id) 'Total Customers'

üî∑ <B> GROUP BY with SUM, ORDER BY </B> 
üëâ Example:  List the total order amount for each customer, sorted high to low. 
<PRE>SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, SUM(O.TotalAmount) 'Total Price'
	FROM [Order] O
