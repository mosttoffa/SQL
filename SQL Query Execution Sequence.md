## SQL Query Execution Sequence (Step-by-step order)
	যখন query লিখি, writing order এমন হয়:
	     SELECT ...
		FROM ...
		JOIN ...
		ON ...
		WHERE ...
		GROUP BY ...
		HAVING ...
		ORDER BY ...
SQL Engine যেভাবে এক্সিকিউট করে, সেটা এমন:
		FROM → ON → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → DISTINCT → ORDER BY → LIMIT
		Sub Query execute first
