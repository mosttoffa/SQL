## FULL JOIN 

-- FULL JOIN (FULL JOIN returns all records from both tables.This includes records that do not match.Rows without a match will have NULL column values.)
	-- FULL JOIN Syntax 
		SELECT column-names 
		FROM table-name1 
		FULL JOIN table-join2 ON column-name1 = column-name2
		WHERE condition 
	-- FULL JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN are the same. The OUTER keyword is optional. 
	-- Example: List all customers and their order dates, including those without orders.
		SELECT CONCAT( C.FirstName ,' ' , C.LastName) Name, O.OrderDate
		FROM Customer C
		FULL JOIN [Order] O ON C.Id=O.CustomerId
		ORDER BY O.OrderDate
	-- Example: Match all customers and suppliers by country
		SELECT CONCAT( C.FirstName ,' ' , C.LastName) Name, C.Country AS CustomerCountry, S.Country AS SupplierCountry, S. CompanyName
		FROM Customer C 
		RIGHT JOIN Supplier S ON C.Country=S.Country
		ORDER BY C.Country, S.Country
